<p id="description">A simple Kanban board application built with React that allows you to create and move tasks between columns.</p>

<h2>🚀 Demo</h2>

[https://vishal-rathod-07.github.io/react-kanban-board/](https://vishal-rathod-07.github.io/react-kanban-board/)

  
  
<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Create new tasks with a name and column.
*   Move tasks between columns by dragging and dropping.
*   Four columns available: "To Do" "In Progress" "Done" and "Archive".
    *   The "Archive" column is used to store tasks that are no longer active but need to be kept for record-keeping purposes. Tasks moved to this column are considered completed and are not included in the active workflow.
*   Uses the react-dnd library for drag and drop functionality.
*   Tasks are stored in local storage so they persist between refreshes
*   Delete tasks with a click of a button
